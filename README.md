## How It's Made
After the user sends a tweet, the server then posts it to the database and renders it in the DOM. Throughout this whole process and moving forward, the computer uses 5 methods (loading the tweets page, post tweets, update likes and retweets, and delete tweets) to send responses back to the client, depending on the user's requests.

## What I Learned
Not only was this the first time I used Express but it was also the first time I had used MongoDB. Creating this application allowed for me to experiment and really process what each line of code was doing. Because I was able to submit multiple tweets, it was easy for me to experiment with my database and I got learn a lot about troubleshooting different errors.
